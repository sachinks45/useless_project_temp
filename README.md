## 🎯 Project Description

The **Ammavan Advice Authenticator** is a satirical web application that uses Google's state-of-the-art **Gemini AI** to analyze unsolicited advice, typically received from Keralite uncles ("Ammavans").  

Users can type or speak the advice directly into the app, which then provides:
1. A **sarcastic classification** of the wisdom  
2. A **passive-aggressive response** to use at the next family gathering  

---

## 🤔 The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

Every year, countless hours of productive **chai-sipping** and **pazham pori-eating** are disrupted by unsolicited advice at family functions. This wisdom, while heartfelt, often feels like recycled content from the 80s.  

Until now, no modern tech solution has existed to *decode*, *classify*, and *combat* these conversations… politely.

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a **cloud-based, AI-powered, voice-enabled** sarcasm generator for Ammavan quotes.  
- **Voice-activated interface** using Web Speech API 🎙️  
- **Real-time AI analysis** via Google Gemini  
- **Passive-aggressive comeback suggestions** so you can escape gracefully
